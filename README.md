# React Redux Job Posting Web App

---

## About

The app uses the following technologies:

* [React](https://github.com/facebook/react)
* [React Router](https://github.com/rackt/react-router)
* [Express](http://expressjs.com)
* [Babel](http://babeljs.io) for ES6 and ES7 magic
* [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io) for bundling
* [Webpack Dev Middleware](http://webpack.github.io/docs/webpack-dev-middleware.html)
* [Webpack Hot Middleware](https://github.com/glenjamin/webpack-hot-middleware)
* [Redux](https://github.com/rackt/redux)'s futuristic [Flux](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2014/05/06/flux.html) implementation
* [Redux Dev Tools](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-devtools) for next generation DX (developer experience). Watch [Dan Abramov's talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsSnOQynTHs).
* [React Router Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router-redux) Redux/React Router bindings.
* [ESLint](http://eslint.org) to maintain a consistent code style
* [redux-form](https://github.com/erikras/redux-form) to manage form state in Redux
* [lru-memoize](https://github.com/erikras/lru-memoize) to speed up form validation
* [multireducer](https://github.com/erikras/multireducer) to combine single reducers into one key-based reducer
* [style-loader](https://github.com/webpack/style-loader), [sass-loader](https://github.com/jtangelder/sass-loader) and [less-loader](https://github.com/webpack/less-loader) to allow import of stylesheets in plain css, sass and less,
* [bootstrap-sass-loader](https://github.com/shakacode/bootstrap-sass-loader) and [font-awesome-webpack](https://github.com/gowravshekar/font-awesome-webpack) to customize Bootstrap and FontAwesome
* [react-helmet](https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet) to manage title and meta tag information on both server and client
* [webpack-isomorphic-tools](https://github.com/halt-hammerzeit/webpack-isomorphic-tools) to allow require() work for statics both on client and server
* [mocha](https://mochajs.org/) to allow writing unit tests for the project.

This is a simple job posting web app built using React, Redux, Webpack, and a Parse backend

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Running Dev Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The first time it may take a little while to generate the first `webpack-assets.json` and complain with a few dozen `[webpack-isomorphic-tools] (waiting for the first Webpack build to finish)` printouts, but be patient. Give it 30 seconds.

## Building and Running Production Server

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```
